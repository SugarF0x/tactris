# Tactris

This is my take on Tactris, featuring the beloved gameplay with an undo twist
which now comes at a progressively increasing cost - set the highscore with the
least mistakes possible!

This is one of the **very** few pet projects I can call _actually finished_ and
be fairly proud of despite the code being an organized mess, but hey, where to
test unorthodox approaches if not in personal crafts?

## Installation

Currently, this app is not on any of the stores and the chances are - it will not
be there any time soon, but maypahs i will get down to figuring out how to
publish apps there. Don't quote me on that tho, I'm quite irresponsible
